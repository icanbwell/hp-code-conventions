# hp-code-conventions

This repo is meant to house code convention configuration files that different repositories can reference as part of the CI pipelines to ensure consistent conventions across repos. In addition, local developer IDE's can reference this so there are no surprizes in the PR. Over time these conventions can be adjusted based on team input.
